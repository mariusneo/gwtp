A* (a-star) search algorithm implementation made in a visual manner.

This is still a very early draft and needs to be seriously improved.

Purpose of the project is to show how the algorithm works in practice
based on the explanations provided here :
http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStarTutorial.htm 

Future steps :
- save maps on the service side and make them searchable after their title (GAE)
- create custom widget to show f, g, h (f = g+h), whether the cell has been visited, or is in the closed list dynamically


Employed technologies :
- GWT
- gwt-platform
